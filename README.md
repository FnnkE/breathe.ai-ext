# breathe.ai
breathe.ai is a web platform dedicated to making health care services more
efficient. The platform
offers a variety of tools including electronic medical record storage and AI assistance. When feeling
under the
weather, the AI (powered by Claude) can help you schedule an appointment while collecting basic
information to pass onto the doctor. When at the appointment, the health professionals can access your
information as well as see what the AI suggests looking out for. As either a patient or worker, you
should not use the advice from the AI to make important decisions.
